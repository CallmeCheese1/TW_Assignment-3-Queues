# TW_Assignment 3

This project demonstrates implementations of basic data structures and algorithms in C++. The main file `main.cpp` runs a series of operations on custom Queue, Linked List, and Sorting functions.

## Features

1. **Queue Operations**
   - Creates a new Queue and pushes ten integer elements into it.
   - Displays the queue and moves the first element to the back.

2. **Recursive Linear Search Function**
   - Uses a recursive linear search to find the last occurrence of a specified value in a vector.
   - Example: Finds the last occurrence of `11` in a predefined vector.

3. **Insertion Sort for Linked Lists**
   - Populates a Linked List with values from the vector.
   - Sorts the list using an insertion sort algorithm tailored for linked lists.
   - Displays the list before and after sorting.
